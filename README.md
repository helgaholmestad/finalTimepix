Programs to simulate and characterized antiproton clusters in a timepix3 detector
This program was developed as a part of my PhD thesis that I will provide a linkt to here as soon as I have defended it. The relevant documentation and manual for running an example of this program is found  [here](FinalTimepixDocumentation.pdf)
